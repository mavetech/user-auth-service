Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a unitified platform to connect, manage and secure microservices
Istio is built on top of envoy, which is a high performance proxy that handles all traffic between microservices.
Istio works by deploying a sidecar container along side each microservice instance
Sidecar container intercepts all traffic to and from the microservice, handling traffic routing, load balancing, service discovery and other tasks
Istio also provides advanced traffic management features like canary deployment, AB testing and fault injection
Istio's Citadel component is responsible for issuing, distributing, and rotating the TLS certificates used by the sidecar proxies for mTLS communication.
mTLS in Istio is well-suited for securing internal communication within the service mesh. It provides a uniform and centralized way to secure service-to-service communication and ensures that all communication within the mesh is encrypted and authenticated.
